# Overnight Monitoring Status Report - June 15, 2025

## Executive Summary
The K3s cluster CSI issues have been partially resolved but the storage system remains unstable. While the fundamental kubelet path issues were fixed, the Longhorn CSI implementation has architectural problems preventing full recovery.

## Current Status (02:05 AM EST)

### Infrastructure
- **All 4 nodes**: Online and Ready (k3s-master1, k3s1, k3s2, k3s3)
- **K3s Version**: v1.32.5+k3s1 (all nodes)
- **Kubelet Path**: Reverted to K3s default `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/kubelet`

### Storage System (Longhorn)
- **Critical Issue**: CSI controller components (attacher, provisioner, etc.) unable to connect to CSI driver
- **Root Cause**: Architecture mismatch - controllers expect local Unix socket but CSI runs as DaemonSet
- **Impact**: Volume attachments failing, preventing pod startup

### Application Status
- **Media Namespace**: 1/9 pods running (only whisparr)
- **Monitoring Stack**: Partially running (Grafana OK, Prometheus/Loki failing)
- **Volume Status**: 8 pods stuck in ContainerCreating due to volume attachment failures

## Issues Identified

### 1. CSI Architecture Problem
The Longhorn CSI implementation has a fundamental design flaw:
- CSI controller pods (attacher, provisioner) are configured to connect via hostPath volume
- They expect a Unix socket at `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/kubelet/plugins/driver.longhorn.io`
- CSI plugin pods run as DaemonSet but controllers run as Deployment
- Result: Controllers cannot find the socket, causing continuous crashes

### 2. Node Authorization Errors
Pods on k3s3 experiencing RBAC errors:
```
User "system:node:k3s3" cannot get resource "volumeattachments" 
```
This may be related to the K3s feature gate configuration.

### 3. Stale Volume Attachments
Multiple volume attachments stuck in "being deleted" state, preventing new attachments.

## Actions Taken Tonight

### Successfully Completed
1. ✅ Rolled back all nodes to K3s default kubelet paths
2. ✅ Fixed critical bug: host-dev volume pointing to /sys instead of /dev
3. ✅ Restored k3s1 as agent node (was misconfigured as server)
4. ✅ Added Longhorn disk configuration for k3s1
5. ✅ Cleaned up stuck volume attachment finalizers
6. ✅ Recreated CSI controller deployments
7. ✅ Force restarted all Longhorn components

### Attempted But Failed
1. ❌ CSI controllers still cannot connect to driver socket
2. ❌ Volume attachments timing out after 2 minutes
3. ❌ Media pods remain stuck in ContainerCreating

## Root Cause Analysis

The previous team's attempt to standardize kubelet paths created cascading failures:
1. Path change broke existing volume mounts
2. Incomplete configuration updates left mixed paths
3. CSI daemonset had duplicate mounts for both old and new paths
4. Host device volume misconfiguration caused container startup failures

While we fixed the path issues, the Longhorn CSI architecture itself appears incompatible with the current cluster configuration.

## Recommendations for Morning Team

### Immediate Actions
1. **Consider Longhorn Reinstall**: The current installation may be corrupted
   ```bash
   helm uninstall longhorn -n longhorn-system
   helm install longhorn longhorn/longhorn --namespace longhorn-system
   ```

2. **Alternative: Manual CSI Fix**: Research Longhorn CSI socket configuration
   - Investigate if controllers can use a different connection method
   - Check if CSI can be configured to expose a network service

3. **Temporary Workaround**: Use local-path provisioner for critical apps
   ```bash
   kubectl patch pvc <pvc-name> -p '{"spec":{"storageClassName":"local-path"}}'
   ```

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Storage Migration**: Consider migrating to a different CSI driver (OpenEBS, Rook/Ceph)
2. **Architecture Review**: The current Longhorn deployment may not be suitable for this K3s setup
3. **Documentation**: Create runbooks for storage system recovery

## Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check CSI health
kubectl get pods -n longhorn-system | grep -v Running

# Check volume attachments
kubectl get volumeattachments | grep -v true

# Check stuck pods
kubectl get pods -A | grep ContainerCreating

# Check CSI logs
kubectl logs -n longhorn-system -l app=csi-attacher --tail=50
```

## Critical Notes
- Do NOT attempt to change kubelet paths again
- The cluster is stable but storage is not fully functional
- Some data may be inaccessible until CSI is fixed
- Backup any critical data once pods are accessible
