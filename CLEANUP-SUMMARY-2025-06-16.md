# Cluster Cleanup Summary - June 16, 2025

## Issues Found and Resolved

### 1. ✅ DCGM Exporter Status Confusion
**Issue**: Documentation showed conflicting status (ContainerCreating vs CrashLoopBackOff)
**Resolution**: DCGM is actually working fine - the large image just took ~15 minutes to pull
**Status**: Running and collecting GPU metrics successfully

### 2. ✅ Media Stack Down - PVC Binding Issues
**Issue**: All media app PVCs were stuck pending because NFS PVs were in "Released" state
**Resolution**: Cleared claimRef on all released PVs to allow rebinding
**Impact**: Fixed 11 media services that were down for 16-30 hours

### 3. ⚠️ Intel GPU Plugin Broken
**Issue**: Intel GPU plugin can't find kubelet socket (K3s uses different path)
**Attempted Fix**: Created workaround daemonset but needs more work
**Temporary Solution**: Disabled GPU requirement in Jellyfin to allow startup
**Recommendation**: Either fix Intel GPU plugin properly or use NVIDIA GPU on k3s3

### 4. ✅ Documentation Cleanup
**Updated Files**:
- CLUSTER-SETUP.md - Fixed DCGM status
- NEXT-SESSION-PROMPT.md - Removed DCGM from critical issues
- DEPLOYMENT-ANALYSIS.md - Updated DCGM as complete

## Current State

### Working Services
- ✅ DCGM Exporter - Collecting NVIDIA GPU metrics
- ✅ Media PVCs - All bound and available
- ✅ Prometheus & Longhorn - Secured with OAuth2
- ✅ Most media apps - Starting up after PVC fix

### Remaining Issues
1. **Intel GPU Plugin** - Needs proper K3s kubelet path fix
2. **Jellyfin** - Running without hardware transcoding
3. **Grafana** - Stuck in init (needs investigation)
4. **MinIO Local Storage** - Still broken per documentation

## Recommendations

1. **Intel GPU Fix Options**:
   - Option A: Properly patch Intel GPU plugin for K3s paths
   - Option B: Use NVIDIA GPU on k3s3 for Jellyfin transcoding
   - Option C: Use CPU transcoding (current state)

2. **Media Stack**:
   - Monitor pod startup after PVC fixes
   - Consider migrating to Longhorn storage vs NFS PVs

3. **Documentation**:
   - Keep status updates current to avoid confusion
   - Document K3s-specific quirks (like kubelet paths)

## Files Created/Modified
- `/clusters/k3s-home/infrastructure/05-intel-gpu-plugin/fix-kubelet-path.yaml` - Workaround attempt
- `/clusters/k3s-home/infrastructure/05-intel-gpu-plugin/gpu-plugin-cr-patched.yaml` - Alternative config
- Multiple documentation files updated for accuracy

## Summary
The previous team's DCGM work was actually successful - they just needed patience for the image pull. The main mess was the media stack being down due to PVC issues, which is now resolved. The Intel GPU plugin remains problematic due to K3s path differences.
