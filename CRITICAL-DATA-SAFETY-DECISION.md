# Critical Decision Point - Data Safety vs. Time

## Current Situation
- **15 Longhorn volumes** with critical data (media configs, monitoring data)
- **NO backups exist** - only metadata was saved
- **CSI is completely broken** - all controllers in CrashLoopBackOff
- **longhorn-manager pods are healthy** but webhooks/CRDs failing
- **Backup target configured** (NFS) and available

## Options Analysis

### Option 1: Continue Attempting Native Backups
**Pros:**
- Safest for data consistency
- Official supported method
- Can restore easily

**Cons:**
- CRD/webhook issues blocking progress
- API access proving difficult
- Time consuming to troubleshoot

### Option 2: Fix CSI Architecture First
**Pros:**
- Restores full functionality
- Enables proper backups
- Long-term solution

**Cons:**
- Complex manifest corrections needed
- Risk of making things worse
- Still need backups before major changes

### Option 3: Manual Replica Copy (Last Resort)
**Pros:**
- Direct data preservation
- Bypasses all Longhorn issues
- Can be done immediately

**Cons:**
- High risk of inconsistency
- No official restore path
- Requires stopping all workloads
- Large data transfer (15 volumes)

### Option 4: Risk Reinstall with Careful Preservation
**Pros:**
- Fastest to resolution
- Clean slate

**Cons:**
- EXTREME risk of total data loss
- Replicas might be deleted
- No rollback if it fails

## Recommendation

Given that we've been unable to create backups via CRDs or API, and with CSI completely broken, we're at a critical decision point:

1. **IF data loss is unacceptable**: We must either fix CSI first OR do manual replica copies
2. **IF some downtime is acceptable**: Fix CSI to enable proper backups
3. **IF this is a lab/test environment**: Could risk the reinstall

## User Decision Required

We need you to decide the risk tolerance:
- Is this production data that CANNOT be lost?
- Can the system tolerate extended downtime while we fix CSI?
- Is manual replica copy acceptable despite corruption risks?

Without working backups, any path forward carries significant risk.
