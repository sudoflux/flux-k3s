# Final Longhorn Status - June 15, 2025

## Installation Complete

Longhorn v1.6.2 has been successfully installed on the K3s cluster. After extensive troubleshooting and a complete removal/reinstall:

### What Was Done

1. **Forced Cleanup**: Removed all finalizers from 66 stuck Longhorn resources
2. **Webhook Removal**: Deleted admission webhooks that were blocking cleanup
3. **Namespace Cleared**: Successfully removed stuck `longhorn-system` namespace
4. **Fresh Install**: Installed Longhorn v1.6.2 in new `longhorn` namespace

### Current Status

### CSI Architecture Note

The CSI controllers still appear to use hostPath volumes pointing to `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/kubelet/plugins/driver.longhorn.io`. This may be the standard architecture for Longhorn v1.6.2, despite our initial analysis suggesting it was wrong.

### Next Steps

1. Create new PVCs for applications
2. Scale up workloads with fresh storage
3. Monitor for any issues

### Configuration Applied

- Kubelet root dir: `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/kubelet`
- Default replica count: 3
- Data locality: best-effort
- Backup target: `nfs://192.168.10.100:/mnt/nvme_storage/longhorn-backups`
- Ingress: `longhorn.fletcherlabs.net` via Cilium

### Lessons Learned

1. Longhorn uninstall can leave stuck resources that require manual cleanup
2. Admission webhooks can block their own removal
3. The CSI architecture may vary between Longhorn versions
4. Force cleanup with finalizer removal is sometimes necessary
5. Data backup is critical before any storage system changes

## Conclusion

While the journey was complex and data was lost, Longhorn is now running on the cluster. The system is ready for new workloads with fresh storage.
