# Day Shift Summary - June 15, 2025

## üéØ Mission Accomplished

Successfully addressed all critical P0 priorities from the Longhorn incident recovery plan. The cluster is now significantly more resilient with proper monitoring, backups, and authentication infrastructure.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Monitoring Stack Storage Migration ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Monitoring was on ephemeral storage, risking data loss
**Solution**: 
- Fixed Longhorn CSI issues with monitoring pods
- Migrated Prometheus and Alertmanager to local-path storage (workaround for fsGroup issues)
- Grafana successfully using Longhorn storage
- All monitoring services fully operational

**Key Files Created**:
- `/scripts/fix-monitoring-fsgroup-comprehensive.sh`
- `/scripts/monitoring-remove-fsgroup-patch.yaml`

### 2. Velero Backup Configuration ‚úÖ
**Problem**: No backup strategy after complete data loss
**Solution**:
- Fixed Velero plugin loading issues
- Configured Backblaze B2 as primary backup location
- Created comprehensive backup schedules:
  - Hourly: Longhorn namespace (24h retention)
  - Daily: Critical namespaces at 2 AM (7-day retention)
  - Weekly: Full cluster on Sundays at 3 AM (30-day retention)
- Successfully tested backup and restore functionality

### 3. SOPS Encryption Verification ‚úÖ
**Status**: Already properly configured
- Age keys exist and backed up
- All secrets properly encrypted
- Flux configured for automatic decryption
- No unencrypted secrets found in repository

### 4. Authentik Deployment ‚úÖ
**Problem**: No authentication gateway, all services exposed
**Solution**:
- Fixed Flux configuration issues (schema errors, dependency names)
- Successfully deployed Authentik with PostgreSQL and Redis
- Accessible at https://authentik.fletcherlabs.net
- Ready for initial admin setup (NO 2FA per directive)

**Key Files Created**:
- `/scripts/authentik-initial-setup.sh` - Setup guide

## üìä Current Cluster State

```yaml
Infrastructure:
  Nodes: All healthy (k3s v1.32.5+k3s1)
  Storage: Longhorn v1.6.2 operational
  Networking: Cilium with Gateway API
  GitOps: Flux fully reconciling

Security:
  Secrets: SOPS encryption active ‚úÖ
  Authentication: Authentik deployed (needs config) ‚ö†Ô∏è
  Backups: Velero with B2 configured ‚úÖ

Monitoring:
  Prometheus: Running (local-path storage) ‚úÖ
  Grafana: Running (longhorn storage) ‚úÖ
  Alertmanager: Running (local-path storage) ‚úÖ
  Loki: Running ‚úÖ
```

## üö® Known Issues

1. **Longhorn fsGroup**: Monitoring pods couldn't use Longhorn due to fsGroup permission issues
   - Workaround: Using local-path storage for affected pods
   - Long-term: Wait for Longhorn update or disable fsGroup enforcement

2. **MinIO Local Backup**: Storage corruption ("0 drives provided")
   - Impact: Local backups unavailable
   - Mitigation: B2 offsite backups working perfectly

3. **DCGM Exporter**: GPU metrics collector in crash loop
   - Impact: No GPU metrics (non-critical)
   - Action: Low priority fix

## üìã Next Priorities

### Medium Priority
1. **Document Procedures**: Update CLUSTER-SETUP.md with incident learnings
2. **Configure Alerts**: Set up Longhorn, CSI, and backup failure alerts
3. **Authentik Configuration**: Create OAuth providers for services

### Low Priority
1. **Fix Traefik**: K3s trying to install Traefik (we use Cilium)
2. **Fix MinIO**: Resolve local backup storage issues
3. **GPU Metrics**: Fix DCGM exporter crash loop

## üîß Quick Commands

```bash
# Check cluster health
kubectl get nodes && kubectl get pods -A | grep -v Running

# Monitor Flux
flux get all -A

# Check backups
velero backup get

# Access services
echo "Longhorn: https://longhorn.fletcherlabs.net"
echo "Grafana: https://grafana.fletcherlabs.net"
echo "Authentik: https://authentik.fletcherlabs.net"
```

## üìù Git Changes

```bash
# Committed changes:
- Fixed monitoring storage classes (longhorn-replicated ‚Üí longhorn-nvme)
- Fixed Authentik Flux configuration (schema and dependency issues)

# Scripts created:
- Monitoring fsGroup fixes
- Authentik initial setup guide
```

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Storage Classes Matter**: Different workloads have different storage requirements
2. **fsGroup Limitations**: Some CSI drivers struggle with fsGroup permissions
3. **Backup First**: Having working backups before making changes is critical
4. **Documentation Saves Time**: Previous shift's docs made recovery much faster

## üéâ Summary

All critical P0 tasks from the incident recovery plan have been completed. The cluster now has:
- ‚úÖ Persistent monitoring storage (with workaround)
- ‚úÖ Automated offsite backups with tested restore
- ‚úÖ Encrypted secrets management
- ‚úÖ Authentication gateway deployed

The cluster is in its best state since the Longhorn incident, with proper data protection and security foundations in place.
