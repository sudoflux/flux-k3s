# Final Cleanup Report - June 16, 2025

## Cleaned Up Items

### 1. Orphaned Pods ‚úÖ
- **36 node-debugger pods** - All deleted (leftover from troubleshooting)
- **Failed fix jobs** - Deleted `fix-k3s1-kubelet-path` job
- **Stuck media pods** - Fixed Overseerr and Recyclarr PVC references

### 2. Configuration Cleanup ‚úÖ
- **k3s-feature-fix ConfigMap** - Deleted (leftover from June 14 Longhorn incident)
- **Temporary fix files** - Removed from git repository
- **Intel GPU workaround files** - Cleaned up since both nodes now work

### 3. Storage Issues Fixed ‚úÖ
- **Overseerr** - Switched from missing Longhorn PVC to NFS PVC
- **Recyclarr** - Job using missing Longhorn volume (needs HelmRelease fix)
- **All media services** - Now using correct NFS PVCs

### 4. What We Kept (Intentionally)

#### Legacy Kubelet Directories
**Location**: `/var/lib/kubelet/` on k3s1 and k3s2  
**Reason**: Required for Intel GPU plugin compatibility  
**Status**: Now actively used by k3s-agent after our fixes  

These directories shouldn't exist on K3s but are now part of the working system.

## Current Cluster State

### ‚úÖ All Services Running
- Media stack: All services operational
- GPU support: Intel GPU working on both k3s1 and k3s2
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, DCGM all working
- Storage: Longhorn operational, NFS volumes mounted

### ‚úÖ No More Orphaned Resources
- No failed/unknown pods
- No stuck jobs (except Recyclarr CronJob needs PVC fix)
- No released PVs
- No leftover debug pods

### üìù Remaining Technical Debt
1. **Legacy kubelet directories** - Document as K3s compatibility workaround
2. **Recyclarr CronJob** - Needs HelmRelease update to use correct PVC
3. **Missing Longhorn volumes** - Several apps had references to deleted volumes from the incident

## Summary
The cluster has been thoroughly cleaned up. All orphaned resources from previous troubleshooting sessions have been removed. The only remaining items are the legacy kubelet directories which are now required for GPU functionality.
