# 3rd Shift Handoff - June 15, 2025

## üéâ Mission Accomplished

Team, we successfully fixed the Longhorn CSI disaster that's been plaguing the cluster for 24+ hours. Here's what we accomplished and what needs attention next.

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

### 1. Longhorn Storage System
- **Status**: Fully operational with 27 healthy pods
- **Version**: Fresh v1.6.2 installation
- **Access**: https://longhorn.fletcherlabs.net
- **Backup Access**: NodePort on 30080

### 2. Root Cause Identified
- Day shift changed kubelet paths without proper migration
- CSI controllers couldn't find driver sockets
- Required complete removal and reinstallation

### 3. Flux GitOps
- Fixed connection issues between controllers
- All kustomizations now reconciling
- HTTPRoute properly configured for Cilium

### 4. Media Applications
- Created new PVCs for all media apps
- Applications scaled back up
- Fresh storage (data was already lost)

## üìÅ Documentation Created

We've created comprehensive documentation for future teams:

1. **`/docs/LONGHORN-INCIDENT-POSTMORTEM-2025-06-15.md`**
   - Full technical analysis
   - Timeline of events
   - Root cause deep dive
   - Lessons learned

2. **`/docs/NEXT-STEPS-AFTER-LONGHORN-2025-06-15.md`**
   - Detailed implementation plan
   - Aligns with original Week 1-4 roadmap
   - Risk mitigation strategies

3. **`/docs/LONGHORN-FIX-SUMMARY-2025-06-15.md`**
   - Quick reference guide
   - Key commands and procedures
   - What worked/what didn't

## üö® Critical Items for Next Shift

### Immediate Priorities (Next 24-48 Hours)

1. **Monitoring Stack on Ephemeral Storage**
   - Still using local-path (will lose data on restart)
   - Need to migrate to Longhorn ASAP
   - Create PVCs: Prometheus (50Gi), Grafana (10Gi), Loki (100Gi)

2. **No Backup Strategy**
   - Velero installed but not configured for offsite
   - Backblaze B2 bucket ready but not connected
   - Need backup schedules configured

3. **Security Gaps**
   - All services exposed without authentication
   - Secrets still in plaintext (no SOPS)
   - Authentik deployed but not configured

### Known Issues

1. **Traefik Installation Failing**
   - K3s trying to install Traefik but CRDs missing
   - Not affecting operation (using Cilium)
   - Can be ignored or disabled

2. **Single Points of Failure Remain**
   - Control plane: k3s-master1 only
   - Storage: R730 NFS server
   - No HA or failover capability

## üìä Current Cluster State

```
Nodes: All healthy
Storage: Longhorn operational, NFS mounted
Networking: Cilium with Gateway API
GitOps: Flux fully operational
Monitoring: Running but on ephemeral storage
Security: Wide open (no auth)
Backups: None configured
```

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

### Day Shift Priorities
1. Migrate monitoring to replicated storage
2. Configure Velero backups
3. Implement SOPS encryption
4. Basic Authentik setup (no 2FA yet)

### Week 1 Goals
- Complete security implementation
- Establish backup routines
- Document procedures
- Test recovery scenarios

## üí° Key Insights

1. **The 3rd Shift Was Right** - They correctly identified Longhorn as broken
2. **Nuclear Option Works** - Sometimes complete removal is the only way
3. **Document Everything** - This incident could have been avoided with better documentation
4. **Test Path Changes** - Kubelet path changes break storage systems

## üõ†Ô∏è Useful Commands

```bash
# Check Longhorn status
kubectl get pods -n longhorn

# Access Longhorn UI
# https://longhorn.fletcherlabs.net
# http://192.168.10.30:30080

# Monitor Flux
flux get all -A

# Emergency cleanup (if needed)
./scripts/force-cleanup-longhorn.sh
```

## üôè Final Notes

- Total incident duration: 24+ hours
- Data loss: Complete (was already accepted)
- Current stability: Good
- Documentation: Comprehensive

The cluster is now in the best state it's been in days. Longhorn is working, Flux is healthy, and we have a clear path forward. The painful nuclear option gave us a clean slate to build properly.

Remember the lessons learned here - especially about kubelet paths and CSI architecture. The documentation we've created should prevent this from happening again.

Good luck with the security and backup implementation. You've got a solid foundation to build on now.
