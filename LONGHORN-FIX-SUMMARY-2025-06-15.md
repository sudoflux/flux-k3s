# Longhorn CSI Fix Summary - June 15, 2025

## The Core Issue
The Longhorn CSI is broken due to architectural misconfiguration in the controller deployments, NOT because Longhorn is incompatible with K3s.

## What's Actually Wrong

### 1. CSI Controller Architecture is Broken
The `csi-attacher`, `csi-provisioner`, `csi-resizer`, and `csi-snapshotter` deployments are missing critical components:

**Current (Broken) State**:
```yaml
# Each controller deployment has:
containers:
- name: csi-attacher  # Only the sidecar!
volumes:
- hostPath:  # Wrong! Points to node's kubelet plugin dir
    path: /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/kubelet/plugins/driver.longhorn.io
```

**Expected (Correct) State**:
```yaml
# Each controller should have:
containers:
- name: csi-attacher          # The sidecar
- name: longhorn-csi-plugin   # The driver that provides the socket!
volumes:
- emptyDir: {}  # Shared between containers in the pod
```

### 2. Why Controllers Can't Connect
- The `csi-attacher` is trying to connect to `unix:///csi/csi.sock`
- This socket should be provided by `longhorn-csi-plugin` container in the same pod
- Since that container is missing, the socket doesn't exist
- Result: "Failed to connect to CSI driver" errors

### 3. DaemonSet Also Has Issues
- Environment variable `$(ADDRESS)` not expanding in node-driver-registrar
- CSI plugin pods crashing on all nodes
- This prevents node-level volume operations

## Root Cause
The `longhorn-driver-deployer` is generating incorrect deployment manifests. When it recreates the CSI controllers, it's using a broken template that:
1. Omits the `longhorn-csi-plugin` container
2. Uses `hostPath` instead of `emptyDir`
3. Creates an architecture that can never work

## Why the 3rd Shift's Conclusion is Wrong
They concluded "we can't use Longhorn on this cluster" because:
- They fixed the kubelet paths but the architecture remained broken
- The driver deployer keeps recreating broken deployments
- Standard troubleshooting doesn't reveal the architectural issue

**BUT**: Longhorn absolutely CAN work on K3s - it just needs proper deployment.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Full Reinstall (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Backup data
kubectl get pv | grep longhorn > /tmp/longhorn-volumes-backup.txt

# 2. Uninstall Longhorn
helm uninstall longhorn -n longhorn-system
kubectl delete namespace longhorn-system --wait

# 3. Clean up nodes
# On each node:
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/kubelet/plugins/driver.longhorn.io
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/kubelet/plugins_registry/driver.longhorn.io

# 4. Reinstall with correct configuration
helm install longhorn longhorn/longhorn \
  --namespace longhorn-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --set csi.kubeletRootDir="/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/kubelet"
```

### Option 2: Manual Fix (Advanced)
Manually patch each controller deployment to add the missing container and fix volumes. This is complex and may be overwritten by the driver deployer.

### Option 3: Fix Driver Deployer
Investigate why the driver deployer is generating incorrect manifests and fix its configuration. This requires deep Longhorn internals knowledge.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Longhorn is fully compatible with K3s** - thousands of deployments prove this
2. **The issue is deployment configuration**, not fundamental incompatibility
3. **The CSI controllers need both sidecar AND driver containers**
4. **hostPath volumes are wrong for controller deployments**
5. **A clean reinstall will restore proper architecture**

## Next Steps

1. Decide on fix approach (recommend full reinstall)
2. Backup any critical data
3. Execute the fix
4. Verify correct architecture post-fix
5. Document lessons learned

The 3rd shift team did excellent diagnostic work but reached the wrong conclusion. Longhorn CAN work - it just needs to be deployed correctly.
