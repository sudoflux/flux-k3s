# Comprehensive K3s Cluster Cleanup Report
**Date**: June 14, 2025  
**Time**: End of Day  
**Team**: DevOps AI Team (Claude Lead, o3-mini Strategy)

## Executive Summary

We performed a thorough cluster cleanup focusing on:
1. Identifying and documenting the k3s1 version mismatch issue
2. Preparing monitoring stack fixes
3. Cleaning up test resources
4. Creating upgrade and cleanup procedures
5. Documenting all findings and actions

## Critical Issue Identified

### k3s1 Version Mismatch
- **Current State**: k3s1 running v1.30.13+k3s1 while other nodes on v1.32.5+k3s1
- **Impact**: Longhorn CSI plugin failing on k3s1, preventing proper storage operations
- **Status**: Node cordoned, upgrade procedure documented

## Actions Completed

### 1. Test Resource Cleanup ✅
- Deleted 4 test/debug pods in error states
- Cleaned up orphaned PV references
- Created cleanup scripts for future use

### 2. Monitoring Stack Preparation ✅
- Created fix script: `/home/josh/flux-k3s/scripts/fix-monitoring-pvcs.sh`
- Script will update all monitoring components to use new Longhorn PVCs
- Ready to execute after k3s1 upgrade

### 3. Documentation Created ✅
- **K3S1-UPGRADE-PROCEDURE.md**: Step-by-step upgrade guide
- **cleanup-old-pvcs.sh**: Script to remove old NFS PVCs
- **fix-monitoring-pvcs.sh**: Script to fix monitoring stack

### 4. Cluster State Analysis ✅
- Identified 6 available local-ssd PVs (can be removed if not needed)
- Found old NFS PVCs in media namespace (migration complete, safe to remove)
- Emergency monitoring PVCs identified for cleanup

## Immediate Actions Required

### Priority 1: Upgrade k3s1 (CRITICAL)
1. SSH to k3s-master1 and create etcd backup
2. Follow procedure in `/home/josh/flux-k3s/docs/K3S1-UPGRADE-PROCEDURE.md`
3. Verify Longhorn CSI plugin becomes healthy on k3s1

### Priority 2: Fix Monitoring Stack
1. After k3s1 upgrade, run: `/home/josh/flux-k3s/scripts/fix-monitoring-pvcs.sh`
2. Verify all monitoring pods start successfully
3. Check Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, and Alertmanager functionality

### Priority 3: Cleanup Old Resources
1. Verify all media apps are stable on Longhorn
2. Run: `/home/josh/flux-k3s/scripts/cleanup-old-pvcs.sh`
3. Remove emergency monitoring PVCs

## Current Cluster Health

### What's Working
- All media apps running on Longhorn (except on k3s1)
- Whisparr optimized with Intel Optane storage
- AI workloads stable on local SSD
- Control plane healthy

### What Needs Attention
- k3s1 node (cordoned, needs upgrade)
- Monitoring stack (pods stuck in init, awaiting fix)
- Old NFS PVCs (ready for cleanup)

## Risk Assessment

1. **k3s1 Upgrade Risk**: Medium
   - Crossing multiple minor versions
   - Mitigation: etcd backup, detailed procedure

2. **Monitoring Fix Risk**: Low
   - Clear fix path identified
   - New PVCs already created

3. **PVC Cleanup Risk**: Low
   - Apps already migrated
   - Cleanup script has confirmation prompt

## Next Session Checklist

- [ ] Create etcd backup on k3s-master1
- [ ] Upgrade k3s1 to v1.32.5+k3s1
- [ ] Verify Longhorn CSI on all nodes
- [ ] Run monitoring stack fix script
- [ ] Clean up old NFS PVCs
- [ ] Configure media applications (lost during migration)
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with lessons learned

## Scripts and Tools Created

1. **fix-monitoring-pvcs.sh**: Updates monitoring stack to use Longhorn PVCs
2. **cleanup-old-pvcs.sh**: Removes old NFS PVCs after confirmation
3. **K3S1-UPGRADE-PROCEDURE.md**: Complete upgrade guide with rollback steps

## Lessons Learned

1. Version consistency across nodes is critical for storage providers
2. Always cordon nodes before major operations
3. Document procedures before executing them
4. Keep emergency/backup PVCs until new solution is verified

## Storage Architecture (Post-Cleanup)
