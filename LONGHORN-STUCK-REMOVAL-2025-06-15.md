# Longhorn Stuck Removal Issue - June 15, 2025

## Current State
Longhorn is completely stuck and cannot be cleanly removed or reinstalled due to:

1. **Namespace Stuck Terminating**: `longhorn-system` namespace has been terminating for 20+ hours
2. **Webhook Issues**: Admission webhooks were deleted but resources still reference them
3. **Finalizers**: 66 resources with `longhorn.io` finalizers that can't be removed
4. **CRDs Ownership**: All CRDs still owned by the original `longhorn-system` namespace release

## Root Cause
The Longhorn uninstall process failed due to the broken CSI architecture, leaving:
- Orphaned resources with finalizers
- Missing webhook service preventing finalizer removal
- CRDs with ownership metadata preventing reuse

## Options

### 1. Force Clean Everything (Nuclear Option)
```bash
# Force patch all resources to remove finalizers
kubectl get all -A | grep longhorn | awk '{print $1 " " $2}' | while read type name; do
  kubectl patch $type $name -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' --type=merge -n $(echo $name | cut -d/ -f1)
done

# Force delete all Longhorn CRDs
kubectl get crd | grep longhorn | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kubectl delete crd --force --grace-period=0

# Wait for namespace to clear
```

### 2. Manual API Server Edit
Edit the namespace directly via API to remove finalizers:
```bash
kubectl proxy &
curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT --data-binary @namespace.json \
  http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/namespaces/longhorn-system/finalize
```

### 3. Restart API Server
Sometimes restarting the K3s API server can help clear stuck resources.

### 4. Use Different Storage Solution
Given the time already lost and data already gone, consider:
- OpenEBS
- Rook/Ceph
- Local-path provisioner
- NFS CSI driver

## Recommendation
Since data is already lost and system is out of production, the nuclear option might be fastest. However, this could leave the cluster in an inconsistent state.

Alternative: Switch to a different storage solution entirely to avoid further Longhorn issues.

## Lessons Learned
1. Always ensure clean uninstall procedures work before deployment
2. Webhook-based admission controllers can block their own removal
3. Longhorn's architecture makes it difficult to recover from certain failure modes
4. The 3rd shift team was more right than we initially thought - Longhorn can become unrecoverable
