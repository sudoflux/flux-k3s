# Longhorn CSI Analysis - June 15, 2025

## Executive Summary
The 3rd shift team's assessment that "we can't use Longhorn on this cluster" is understandable given the current broken state, but it's not accurate. The issue is a misconfiguration caused by the day shift's path changes, not a fundamental incompatibility.

## What the Day Shift Did Wrong

### 1. Changed Kubelet Paths Without Full Understanding
- Changed from K3s default `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/kubelet` to standard `/var/lib/kubelet`
- This seemed to work initially but created cascading configuration issues
- The change was incomplete - some components used old paths, others new

### 2. Incomplete Configuration Updates
- The Longhorn CSI DaemonSet had duplicate volume mounts for both paths
- The CSI controller deployments got corrupted during the changes
- Critical bug introduced: host-dev volume pointing to `/sys` instead of `/dev`

### 3. Architectural Corruption
The most severe issue: CSI controller deployments lost their proper architecture:
- **Expected**: Controllers run with two containers (attacher + plugin) sharing a socket via emptyDir
- **Actual**: Controllers have only one container trying to mount a hostPath to the DaemonSet's socket

## Why the 3rd Shift Concluded Longhorn Won't Work

After rolling back the kubelet paths, they found:
1. CSI controllers crash-looping with "Failed to connect to CSI driver"
2. Volume attachments timing out after 2 minutes
3. 8 pods stuck in ContainerCreating state
4. Even after fixes, the architecture remained broken

Their conclusion makes sense because:
- The rollback fixed the paths but not the corrupted deployment architecture
- Standard Helm upgrade fails due to template errors
- The CSI appears fundamentally broken

## The Real Issue: Corrupted Deployment Architecture

The CSI controllers are trying to use a **hostPath** volume to connect to a socket that only exists on specific nodes where the DaemonSet runs. This can never work in a multi-node cluster.

### Current (Broken) Architecture:
```yaml
volumes:
- hostPath:
    path: /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/kubelet/plugins/driver.longhorn.io
containers:
- name: csi-attacher  # Only one container!
```

### Correct Architecture:
```yaml
volumes:
- emptyDir: {}  # Shared memory volume
containers:
- name: csi-attacher
- name: longhorn-csi-plugin  # Provides the socket
```

## Why Longhorn CAN Work on This Cluster

1. **K3s is fully compatible with Longhorn** - thousands of deployments prove this
2. **The nodes are properly configured** - rolled back to K3s defaults
3. **The issue is just misconfigured deployments** - fixable with clean reinstall
4. **All the infrastructure is healthy** - nodes ready, storage available

## Path Forward

1. **Clean reinstall of Longhorn** will restore proper CSI architecture
2. **Data can be preserved** if needed (though backups recommended)
3. **Explicit K3s configuration** ensures correct paths
4. **Proper sidecar pattern** will be restored by Helm charts

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never change fundamental paths** without understanding all dependencies
2. **CSI architecture is complex** - controllers need specific pod configurations
3. **Rollbacks must be complete** - configuration and deployments, not just nodes
4. **Helm charts encode critical patterns** - manual edits can break architectures

## Conclusion

The 3rd shift team did excellent detective work identifying the architectural issues. However, their conclusion that Longhorn can't work is premature. The day shift's path changes corrupted the CSI deployment architecture in a way that survives the node-level rollback. A clean reinstall will restore the proper architecture and functionality.

**Bottom Line**: Longhorn absolutely can work on this K3s cluster - it just needs its deployment architecture restored to the correct sidecar pattern.
