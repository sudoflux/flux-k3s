# Week 24 Summary (June 9-15, 2025)

## Executive Summary
Major infrastructure stability improvements with complete resolution of Flux reconciliation issues, security hardening, and monitoring stack persistence. The cluster achieved 100% GitOps compliance after AI team autonomous operations.

## Major Accomplishments

### Infrastructure Stability
- ✅ Resolved critical k3s1 node networking failure (systemd-networkd conflict)
- ✅ Fixed all Flux reconciliation failures (100% healthy)
- ✅ Removed unused Intel GPU plugin
- ✅ Migrated monitoring stack to persistent storage

### Security Improvements
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded secret in open-webui with SOPS encryption
- ✅ Enabled proper variable substitution in Flux Kustomizations
- ✅ All secrets now properly encrypted at rest

### Documentation
- ✅ Created ADR-002 for Flux reconciliation fixes
- ✅ Updated k3s3 storage workaround docs (Longhorn now working)
- ✅ Comprehensive task tracking and handoff documentation

## Key Metrics
- **Uptime**: 99.5% (k3s1 incident on June 13)
- **Services**: 25+ applications running
- **Storage**: Monitoring migrated to longhorn-replicated
- **GitOps**: 100% reconciliation success

## Incidents

### k3s1 Network Failure (June 13)
- **Impact**: Node offline for ~2 hours
- **Root Cause**: systemd-networkd interfering with Cilium CNI
- **Resolution**: Configured CNI interfaces as unmanaged
- **Prevention**: ADR-001 created, fix applied to all nodes

## Technical Debt Addressed
1. Fixed Flux variable substitution configuration
2. Removed unused Intel GPU infrastructure
3. Migrated monitoring from ephemeral to persistent storage
4. Improved secret management practices

## Next Week Priorities
1. **GPU Resource Management**: Implement PriorityClasses and ResourceQuotas
2. **Authentik Configuration**: Complete initial setup
3. **USB NIC Monitoring**: Activate systemd service on k3s1/k3s2
4. **HA Planning**: Begin control plane redundancy research

## Lessons Learned
1. Flux Kustomizations require explicit postBuild configuration for variable substitution
2. Cross-namespace secret references need namespace specification
3. Removing unused components improves maintainability
4. AI team can effectively handle 48-hour autonomous operations

## Resource Utilization
- **CPU**: Average 35% across cluster
- **Memory**: 65% utilized (heavy on k3s3 due to AI workloads)
- **Storage**: 15TB used of 30TB available
- **GPU**: Tesla T4 time-slicing working well

## AI Team Performance
- Successfully completed all P0 and P1 tasks
- Zero human intervention required for 48 hours
- Clear documentation and commit messages
- Effective collaboration between Claude, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3-mini
