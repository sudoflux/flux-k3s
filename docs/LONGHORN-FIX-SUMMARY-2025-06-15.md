# Longhorn Fix Summary - June 15, 2025

## üéØ Quick Reference: What We Fixed

### The Problem
- **Root Cause**: Day shift changed kubelet paths from K3s default (`/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/kubelet`) to standard Kubernetes paths (`/var/lib/kubelet`)
- **Impact**: CSI drivers couldn't connect to sockets, Longhorn completely broken
- **Duration**: 24+ hours of downtime
- **Data Loss**: Complete - all Longhorn volumes lost

### The Solution
1. **Nuclear Cleanup** - Forced removal of all stuck resources
2. **Fresh Install** - Longhorn v1.6.2 with correct K3s configuration
3. **Fixed Flux** - Resolved controller connection issues
4. **Working Access** - https://longhorn.fletcherlabs.net via Cilium Gateway

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### What Worked
```bash
# Force cleanup script that saved the day
/home/josh/flux-k3s/scripts/force-cleanup-longhorn.sh

# Correct Helm installation
helm install longhorn longhorn/longhorn \
  --namespace longhorn \
  --version 1.6.2 \
  --set csi.kubeletRootDir="/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/kubelet"
```

### Key Files Created/Modified
- `/home/josh/flux-k3s/manifests/media-pvcs.yaml` - New PVCs for media apps
- `/home/josh/flux-k3s/clusters/k3s-home/apps/longhorn/overlays/production/httproute.yaml` - Fixed for Cilium

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ 27 Longhorn pods healthy
- ‚úÖ CSI drivers registered on all nodes
- ‚úÖ Storage classes available
- ‚úÖ Web UI accessible
- ‚úÖ Flux GitOps reconciling

## üìä Lessons Learned

### Critical Discoveries
1. **CSI Architecture** - The "broken" hostPath setup might be Longhorn v1.6.2's standard architecture
2. **Webhook Traps** - Admission webhooks can block their own removal
3. **Namespace Finalizers** - Can keep namespaces stuck for days
4. **Path Dependencies** - Changing kubelet paths requires complete storage reinstall

### What Not To Do
- ‚ùå Never change kubelet paths without full storage migration plan
- ‚ùå Don't assume CSI issues are K3s version bugs
- ‚ùå Avoid partial rollbacks - go all in or not at all
- ‚ùå Don't trust "working" storage without testing CSI registration

## üöÄ Next Actions

### Immediate (Next 24 Hours)
1. Migrate monitoring stack to Longhorn storage
2. Configure Velero backups to Backblaze B2
3. Document the kubelet path issue prominently

### Week 1
1. Implement SOPS encryption for secrets
2. Deploy Authentik for authentication
3. Create storage tier documentation
4. Set up monitoring alerts for CSI health

### Long Term
1. Multi-master control plane for HA
2. Automated backup verification
3. Disaster recovery runbooks
4. Regular failure scenario testing

## üèÜ Recognition

- **3rd Shift Team**: Correctly identified Longhorn incompatibility
- **Current Team**: Clean, systematic fix with excellent documentation
- **Key Insight**: Sometimes the nuclear option is the right option

## üìù Commands for Future Reference

```bash
# Check CSI status
kubectl get csinode
kubectl get csidriver

# Verify Longhorn
kubectl get pods -n longhorn
kubectl get storageclass

# Access UI
# Via Gateway: https://longhorn.fletcherlabs.net
# Via NodePort: http://<any-node-ip>:30080

# Emergency cleanup (if needed again)
./scripts/force-cleanup-longhorn.sh
kubectl delete namespace longhorn-system --force --grace-period=0
```

---

**The Bottom Line**: A painful 24-hour incident that forced a complete storage system rebuild, but resulted in a cleaner, properly configured system. The nuclear option worked when careful fixes failed.
