# Next Steps After Longhorn Resolution - June 15, 2025

## üéØ Executive Summary

The Longhorn CSI crisis has been resolved through complete reinstallation. While this was painful (24-hour outage, data loss), it provides a clean slate to properly implement the original homelab resilience plan. This document outlines the path forward, incorporating lessons learned.

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed

1. **Longhorn v1.6.2** - Fresh installation with correct K3s paths
2. **Flux GitOps** - Resolved connection issues between controllers
3. **HTTPRoute Access** - Longhorn UI available at https://longhorn.fletcherlabs.net
4. **Media PVCs** - New volumes created for all media applications

## üö® Critical Gaps Remaining

### 1. Storage Architecture (Week 1-2 Priority)
- ‚ùå **No replicated storage for monitoring stack** - Still on ephemeral local-path
- ‚ùå **No backup strategy** - Velero configured but not storing offsite
- ‚ùå **No data protection** - Lost all data during incident

### 2. Authentication & Security (Week 1 Priority)
- ‚ùå **No authentication** - All services publicly exposed
- ‚ùå **Secrets in plain text** - SOPS not implemented
- ‚ùå **No RBAC** - Full cluster access for any authenticated user

### 3. Observability (Week 2-3)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Basic monitoring only** - No storage or CSI metrics
- ‚ùå **No alerting** - Silent failures like this incident
- ‚ùå **No log aggregation** - Difficult troubleshooting

### 4. High Availability (Month 2)
- ‚ùå **Single control plane** - k3s-master1 is SPOF
- ‚ùå **Single storage server** - R730 failure = total loss
- ‚ùå **No tested recovery procedures**

## üìã Immediate Action Plan (Next 48 Hours)

### Day 1 - Critical Fixes
1. **Migrate Monitoring to Longhorn**
   ```bash
   # Create longhorn-replicated PVCs for:
   # - Prometheus (50Gi)
   # - Grafana (10Gi)
   # - Loki (100Gi)
   ```

2. **Implement Velero Backups**
   - Configure Backblaze B2 bucket
   - Create backup schedules for all namespaces
   - Test restore procedure

3. **Document Current State**
   - Update CLUSTER-SETUP.md with lessons learned
   - Create runbooks for common operations
   - Document the kubelet path issue prominently

### Day 2 - Security Basics
1. **Deploy SOPS**
   - Generate age keys
   - Encrypt existing secrets
   - Update Flux to decrypt

2. **Basic Authentik Setup**
   - Deploy without 2FA initially
   - Protect Longhorn, Grafana, and Hubble UIs
   - Create admin users

## üìÖ Week 1-2 Implementation Plan

### Storage Resilience ‚úÖ
Building on the clean Longhorn installation:

1. **Tiered Storage Classes**
   ```yaml
   # Already configured:
   - longhorn-optane   # Ultra-performance (k3s3 Optane)
   - longhorn-nvme     # High-performance (k3s3 NVMe)
   - longhorn-sas-ssd  # Standard performance (k3s3 SAS)
   - longhorn          # Default replicated storage
   ```

2. **Migration Priority**
   - **Immediate**: Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
   - **Week 1**: Authentication (Authentik), Certificates (cert-manager)
   - **Week 2**: AI workloads (Ollama, Automatic1111 models)
   - **Keep on NFS**: Media files (30TB too large for replication)

3. **Backup Strategy**
   ```yaml
   # Velero with Backblaze B2:
   - Hourly: Longhorn snapshots
   - Daily: Velero backup to B2
   - Weekly: Full cluster backup
   - Monthly: Offsite archive
   ```

### Security Implementation üîí

1. **SOPS Encryption**
   - All secrets encrypted at rest in Git
   - Age keys backed up securely
   - Flux automatic decryption

2. **Authentik Gateway**
   - OAuth2/OIDC for all services
   - Group-based access control
   - Audit logging enabled

3. **Network Policies**
   - Deny all by default
   - Explicit ingress/egress rules
   - Service mesh consideration for future

### Observability Stack üìä

1. **Metrics Enhancement**
   ```yaml
   # Add to kube-prometheus-stack:
   - Longhorn ServiceMonitor
   - CSI metrics collection
   - Node filesystem alerts
   - PVC usage alerts
   ```

2. **Critical Alerts**
   - Longhorn volume health
   - CSI driver status
   - Node disk space
   - Backup job failures
   - Authentication failures

3. **Runbook Integration**
   - Link alerts to documentation
   - Include fix procedures
   - Test alert responses

## üö¶ Risk Mitigation

### Learned from Incident
1. **Change Management**
   - Document ALL infrastructure changes
   - Test in isolated environment first
   - Have rollback plan ready
   - Communicate across shifts

2. **Monitoring Gaps**
   - CSI driver health checks
   - Kubelet configuration alerts
   - Volume mount verification
   - Cross-namespace dependencies

3. **Recovery Procedures**
   - VM snapshots before changes
   - Flux suspend for emergencies
   - Nuclear cleanup scripts ready
   - Data backup verification

## üìù Documentation Requirements

### Must Create
1. **Longhorn Operations Guide**
   - Volume management
   - Backup procedures
   - Troubleshooting CSI issues
   - Performance tuning

2. **Security Runbook**
   - SOPS key management
   - Secret rotation procedures
   - Authentik user management
   - Incident response

3. **Change Management Process**
   - Pre-change checklist
   - Testing requirements
   - Rollback procedures
   - Communication template

## üéñÔ∏è Team Recognition

The 3rd shift team correctly identified the Longhorn issues early. Their assessment that "we can't use Longhorn on this cluster" was more accurate than initially credited - the CSI architecture was indeed fundamentally broken after the kubelet path change.

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

1. **Weekly Reviews**
   - Storage metrics analysis
   - Security posture assessment
   - Backup verification
   - Incident review

2. **Monthly Drills**
   - Disaster recovery test
   - Control plane failure
   - Storage node failure
   - Network partition

3. **Quarterly Planning**
   - Architecture evolution
   - Capacity planning
   - Technology refresh
   - Team training

## üöÄ Final Thoughts

While the Longhorn incident was painful, it forced a clean-slate approach that positions the cluster better for the future. The nuclear cleanup removed years of technical debt in one swift action. Now we can build it right from the ground up.

**Remember**: "Perfect is the enemy of good." Start with basic protection, then iterate. The goal is resilience, not perfection.

**Key Principle**: Every system should be able to fail without data loss or extended downtime. Build with failure in mind.
