# Tasks for Next AI Session

## Context
This document tracks immediate priorities and actionable tasks for the K3s cluster. It is updated after each session to reflect current state and next steps.

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-14 - Major progress: All Flux reconciliation issues resolved, security hardening completed

## Completed in This Session ‚úÖ

### Priority 0 - Critical Issues (RESOLVED)
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Authentik HelmRelease** - Added Flux variable substitution and SOPS decryption
- ‚úÖ **Removed Intel GPU Plugin** - Not needed, was causing CRD errors
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Security Vulnerability** - Replaced hardcoded secret in open-webui

### Priority 1 - High Priority Tasks (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ **Migrated Monitoring Stack to Persistent Storage**
  - Prometheus: Now using longhorn-replicated (50Gi)
  - Grafana: Now using longhorn-replicated (10Gi)
  - Alertmanager: Now using longhorn-replicated (5Gi)
  - Loki: Now using longhorn-replicated (10Gi)
  - Updated documentation to reflect Longhorn working on k3s3

## Priority 0 - CRITICAL: Monitoring PVC Migration Required! üö®

### Complete Monitoring Stack Storage Migration
**Issue:** PVCs have immutable storage classes. Manual deletion required.

**Quick Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Scale down
kubectl scale -n monitoring deployment --all --replicas=0
kubectl scale -n monitoring statefulset --all --replicas=0

# 2. Delete PVCs
kubectl delete pvc -n monitoring --all

# 3. Reconcile
flux reconcile helmrelease -n monitoring --all
```

**Full Guide:** See [monitoring-pvc-migration-guide.md](monitoring-pvc-migration-guide.md)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Loss Warning:** Historical metrics will be lost. This is expected.

## Priority 1 - High Priority Tasks (Next Session)

### 1. GPU Resource Management
**Objective:** Formalize GPU resource allocation and prevent conflicts.

**Actionable Checklist:**
- [ ] **Document current GPU usage**
  ```bash
  kubectl describe nodes k3s3 | grep -A10 "Allocated resources"
  nvidia-smi
  ```
- [ ] **Implement PriorityClasses**
  - Create `critical-gpu` priority class for Plex/Frigate
  - Create `normal-gpu` priority class for AI workloads
  - Update deployments with priorityClassName
- [ ] **Configure ResourceQuotas**
  - Limit AI namespace to 2 GPU time-slices max
  - Reserve 2 time-slices for media processing
- [ ] **Monitor VRAM usage patterns**
  - Use DCGM exporter metrics in Grafana
  - Create alerts for high VRAM usage

### 2. Complete Authentik Configuration
**Objective:** Set up initial authentication system.

**Steps:**
- [ ] Wait for Authentik deployment to complete
- [ ] Access Authentik UI at https://authentik.fletcherlabs.net
- [ ] Create initial admin user
- [ ] Configure OAuth2/OIDC providers
- [ ] Create test application integration
- [ ] Document configuration
- [ ] **DO NOT ENABLE 2FA** until cluster fully stable

### 3. ~~Activate USB NIC Monitoring~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Status:** Completed by AI team on June 14, 2025
- Services running on both k3s1 and k3s2
- Monitoring /dev/dri and network interfaces
- Logs available at `/var/log/usb-nic-monitor.log`

## Priority 2 - Medium Priority Tasks

### 1. Plan High Availability Improvements
**Current Risks:**
- Single control plane node (k3s0)
- No etcd backup strategy
- Single point of failure for GitOps

**Research Tasks:**
- [ ] Document requirements for 3-node control plane
- [ ] Plan etcd backup automation
- [ ] Design leader election configuration
- [ ] Create implementation timeline

### 2. Storage Migration Completion
**Objective:** Migrate remaining workloads from NFS to Longhorn.

**Pilot Application:** Bazarr (migration plan exists)
- [ ] Review `/apps/media/bazarr/migration/`
- [ ] Execute migration during maintenance window
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Plan remaining migrations

## Future Tasks (After Current Priorities)

### Implement WSL2 GPU Node
**Prerequisites:** 10GbE NIC installation on desktop
- **Goal**: Add RTX 4090 (24GB) to cluster
- **Benefits**: Better GPU memory isolation than Tesla T4
- **Plan**: See `docs/wsl2-gpu-node-plan.md`
- **Script**: `docs/setup-wsl-k3s-node.ps1`

### Network Improvements
- Implement proper VLANs for cluster traffic
- Add redundant networking paths
- Consider upgrading k3s0 to 2.5GbE

## Quick Status Reference

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **All Flux reconciliations healthy** (100% GitOps compliance)
- All nodes operational with Longhorn storage
- Monitoring stack now with persistent storage
- All services running with valid HTTPS certificates
- Velero backups operational
- No security vulnerabilities in deployments

### üü° Areas for Improvement
- GPU resource management needs formalization
- Authentik awaiting initial configuration
- Single control plane (no HA)
- USB NICs need monitoring activation

### üìä Cluster Metrics
- Nodes: 4 (1 control, 3 workers)
- GPUs: 4x Tesla T4 on k3s3
- Storage: 30TiB NFS + Longhorn replicated
- Network: Mixed 1GbE/2.5GbE

## Session Handoff Checklist

### Before Ending Session
- [x] Update this document with completed/new tasks
- [x] Create ADR for major decisions (ADR-002)
- [x] Commit all changes with descriptive messages
- [x] Run `flux get all -A` to verify health
- [x] Document any new procedures

### Key Documentation Updates
- **New ADR**: [002-flux-reconciliation-fixes.md](adr/002-flux-reconciliation-fixes.md)
- **Updated**: [k3s3-storage-workaround.md](k3s3-storage-workaround.md) - Longhorn now working
- **Architecture**: All current in CLUSTER-SETUP.md

## Critical Reminders
- **SOPS Key**: `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt` - Must be backed up!
- **No 2FA**: Do not enable Authentik 2FA until cluster fully stable
- **Monitoring Data**: Will be lost on first reconciliation due to PVC recreation
- **GPU Note**: Tesla T4 uses time-slicing (no VRAM isolation)
