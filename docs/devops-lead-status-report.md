# DevOps Lead Status Report - June 13, 2025

## Executive Summary
Significant progress made on production readiness initiatives. TLS infrastructure deployed, backup systems configured, and monitoring stack operational. Key blockers identified with clear paths to resolution.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Monitoring Stack Deployment ✅
- **Status**: Fully operational
- **Components**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, DCGM GPU exporter
- **Resolution**: Fixed Pod Security Standards blocking node-exporter by restarting DaemonSets
- **Access**: http://grafana.fletcherlabs.net

### 2. TLS/HTTPS Infrastructure ✅
- **cert-manager**: v1.16.2 deployed and running
- **Let's Encrypt**: Staging and production issuers configured
- **Gateway API**: Updated for HTTPS support
- **Blocker**: DNS not pointing to cluster (192.168.10.224)

### 3. Backup Infrastructure ✅
- **Local Backups**: MinIO deployed with NFS storage (500GB)
- **Offsite Provider**: Wasabi configured (awaiting credentials)
- **Schedules**: Daily local, weekly/monthly offsite defined
- **Fix Applied**: Corrected MinIO secret reference issue

## Current Issues Requiring Attention

### Priority 1: DNS Configuration
- **Issue**: *.fletcherlabs.net domains not pointing to cluster
- **Impact**: TLS certificates cannot be issued via HTTP-01 validation
- **Action Required**: Update DNS A records to point to 192.168.10.224

### Priority 2: Wasabi Credentials
- **Issue**: Offsite backup credentials needed
- **Impact**: Offsite backups paused until credentials provided
- **Action Required**: Follow secure credential injection process in docs/velero-offsite-setup.md

### Priority 3: k3s3 Longhorn CSI
- **Issue**: CSI driver not registered on k3s3 node
- **Impact**: Alertmanager and Loki pods stuck
- **Decision**: Using local-path storage as permanent workaround
- **Documentation**: In progress

## Architecture Decisions Made

### 1. Storage Strategy
- **Decision**: Abandon k3s3 Longhorn CSI troubleshooting
- **Rationale**: Time investment vs. value not justified
- **Alternative**: local-path storage meets monitoring needs

### 2. TLS Approach
- **Decision**: Multi-domain certificate instead of wildcard
- **Rationale**: HTTP-01 validation simpler than DNS-01
- **Trade-off**: Less flexible but faster implementation

### 3. Backup Provider
- **Decision**: Continue with Wasabi instead of switching to Backblaze B2
- **Rationale**: Already partially configured, minimizes changes

## Next Phase Priorities

1. **Immediate** (After DNS/Credentials):
   - Complete TLS certificate issuance
   - Verify offsite backup functionality
   - Document storage workaround

2. **Short-term** (Next Week):
   - Plan control plane HA architecture
   - Review and optimize resource usage
   - Create runbooks for common operations

3. **Long-term** (Month 2):
   - Implement control plane HA
   - Add service mesh for mTLS
   - Expand monitoring with custom dashboards

## Infrastructure Health

- **Cluster**: 4 nodes operational
- **Services**: All media and AI apps running
- **Storage**: NFS operational, Longhorn partial
- **Networking**: BGP established, Gateway functional
- **Security**: SOPS encryption active, Authentik deployed

## Recommendations

1. **DNS Update**: Critical path item - update immediately
2. **Credential Management**: Consider External Secrets Operator for future
3. **Documentation**: Continue GitOps approach for all changes
4. **Testing**: Implement automated backup restore tests
