# DevOps Team Session Handoff - K3s Homelab Cluster

## üö® CRITICAL UPDATE - Longhorn CSI Fixed After 24-Hour Outage! üö®

### Major Incident Resolved (June 15, 2025)

**Previous Issue**: Day shift changed kubelet paths which completely broke Longhorn CSI  
**Resolution**: Complete removal and fresh installation of Longhorn v1.6.2  
**Current Status**: ‚úÖ Storage operational, Flux healthy, cluster stable

### Essential Reading Before Starting
1. **[LONGHORN-INCIDENT-POSTMORTEM-2025-06-15.md](docs/LONGHORN-INCIDENT-POSTMORTEM-2025-06-15.md)** - Full technical analysis
2. **[NEXT-STEPS-AFTER-LONGHORN-2025-06-15.md](docs/NEXT-STEPS-AFTER-LONGHORN-2025-06-15.md)** - Your implementation roadmap
3. **[3RD-SHIFT-HANDOFF-2025-06-15.md](3RD-SHIFT-HANDOFF-2025-06-15.md)** - What we fixed and what's left

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Context
- **Data Loss**: Complete - all previous Longhorn volumes were lost
- **Root Cause**: Kubelet path change from `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/kubelet` to `/var/lib/kubelet`
- **Fix Applied**: Nuclear cleanup + fresh install with correct K3s paths
- **Lesson Learned**: NEVER change kubelet paths without full storage migration

## Current Session Accomplishments (June 15, 2025)

1. **Longhorn Complete Reinstallation** ‚úÖ
   - Forced removal of 66 stuck resources with finalizers
   - Deleted stuck namespace after 20+ hours
   - Fresh Longhorn v1.6.2 with correct K3s kubelet paths
   - Created new PVCs for all media applications

2. **Flux GitOps Repair** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed kustomize-controller connection to source-controller
   - Resolved "operation not permitted" errors
   - All kustomizations now reconciling properly

3. **HTTPRoute Configuration** ‚úÖ
   - Configured Cilium Gateway API for Longhorn
   - Access working at https://longhorn.fletcherlabs.net
   - NodePort backup access on port 30080

4. **Comprehensive Documentation** ‚úÖ
   - Created incident postmortem with root cause analysis
   - Detailed next steps implementation plan
   - Quick reference guides for future incidents

## Current Cluster State

### Infrastructure Status
- **All Nodes**: v1.32.5+k3s1 with K3s default paths restored ‚úÖ
- **Longhorn**: v1.6.2 fresh installation, 27 healthy pods ‚úÖ
- **Storage**: New volumes created, old data lost ‚úÖ
- **Flux GitOps**: Fully operational ‚úÖ

### Application Status

#### Storage & Data
- ‚úÖ **Longhorn**: Operational with correct CSI configuration
- ‚úÖ **Media Apps**: Running with fresh PVCs (no data)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Monitoring**: Still on ephemeral local-path storage
- ‚ùå **Backups**: Velero installed but not configured

#### Security & Access
- ‚úÖ **Longhorn UI**: https://longhorn.fletcherlabs.net
- ‚ùå **Authentication**: No auth gateway (Authentik not configured)
- ‚ùå **Secrets**: Plain text in Git (SOPS not implemented)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Traefik**: K3s trying to install but failing (we use Cilium)

### Critical Gaps
1. **Monitoring on ephemeral storage** - Will lose data on pod restart
2. **No backup strategy** - Another incident = data loss
3. **No authentication** - All services publicly exposed
4. **No HA** - Single control plane and storage server

## Immediate Priorities for Next Session

### P0 - Storage Migration (Day 1)
1. **Migrate Monitoring to Longhorn** ‚ö°
   ```bash
   # Create PVCs for monitoring namespace
   # Prometheus: 50Gi, Grafana: 10Gi, Loki: 100Gi
   # See docs/NEXT-STEPS-AFTER-LONGHORN-2025-06-15.md
   ```

2. **Configure Velero Backups** ‚ö°
   ```bash
   # Backblaze B2 bucket already created
   # Need to configure backup schedules
   # Test restore procedure immediately
   ```

### P1 - Security Implementation (Day 1-2)
1. **Deploy SOPS Encryption**
   - Generate age keys and backup
   - Encrypt all secrets in Git
   - Configure Flux decryption

2. **Basic Authentik Setup**
   - Deploy without 2FA initially
   - Protect critical UIs (Longhorn, Grafana)
   - Create admin accounts

### P2 - Operational Excellence
1. **Document Everything**
   - Update CLUSTER-SETUP.md with incident learnings
   - Create runbooks for common operations
   - Test recovery procedures

## Quick Health Checks
```bash
# Verify Longhorn is healthy
kubectl get pods -n longhorn -o wide

# Check storage classes
kubectl get storageclass

# Verify Flux status
flux get all -A

# Access Longhorn UI
# https://longhorn.fletcherlabs.net
# http://<node-ip>:30080
```

## Key Technical Context

### What Broke Everything
- Day shift changed kubelet paths from K3s default to standard
- CSI drivers couldn't find socket files
- Longhorn architecture completely broken
- Required nuclear cleanup approach

### How We Fixed It
1. **Force removed finalizers** from 66 stuck resources
2. **Deleted admission webhooks** blocking cleanup
3. **Fresh Longhorn install** with correct K3s paths
4. **Fixed Flux controllers** network connectivity

## Collaboration Tools Available
Continue using zen MCP for complex issues:
- `mcp__zen__debug` - Deep troubleshooting (used for volume issues)
- `mcp__zen__thinkdeep` - Architecture decisions
- `mcp__zen__analyze` - Configuration analysis

## Important Scripts/Files Created
- `/home/josh/flux-k3s/scripts/force-cleanup-longhorn.sh` - Nuclear cleanup script
- `/home/josh/flux-k3s/docs/LONGHORN-INCIDENT-POSTMORTEM-2025-06-15.md` - Full analysis
- `/home/josh/flux-k3s/docs/NEXT-STEPS-AFTER-LONGHORN-2025-06-15.md` - Implementation plan
- `/home/josh/flux-k3s/manifests/media-pvcs.yaml` - New PVC definitions

## Session Summary

This was a critical incident response session that:
- Resolved a 24-hour Longhorn outage through complete reinstallation
- Fixed broken Flux GitOps controllers
- Created comprehensive documentation for future reference
- Established clear priorities aligned with original resilience plan

The cluster is now stable with working storage, but critical gaps remain in monitoring persistence, backup strategy, and security. Follow the documented next steps to build proper resilience.
