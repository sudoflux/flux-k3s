# Next Session Prompt - K3s Homelab Cluster

## ðŸŽ‰ Major Progress Update - June 15, 2025

The cluster has been successfully recovered from the Longhorn CSI incident with all critical P0 priorities completed!

## âœ… What's Been Accomplished

### Critical Infrastructure Recovery (All P0 Complete)
1. **Monitoring Stack** âœ…
   - Migrated from ephemeral to persistent storage
   - Working around Longhorn fsGroup issues with local-path
   - All monitoring services operational

2. **Backup Strategy** âœ…
   - Velero configured with Backblaze B2
   - Automated schedules: Hourly (Longhorn), Daily (critical), Weekly (full)
   - Backup/restore tested and verified

3. **Security Foundation** âœ…
   - SOPS encryption already working perfectly
   - All secrets properly encrypted with age keys
   - Authentik deployed and accessible

## ðŸ“Š Current Cluster State

```yaml
Status: STABLE AND PROTECTED
- Storage: Longhorn v1.6.2 operational
- Backups: Automated to B2 cloud storage
- Monitoring: Fully operational with persistence
- Security: SOPS active, Authentik ready for config
- GitOps: Flux fully reconciling
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Priorities

### Priority 1 - Authentik Configuration
1. Navigate to https://authentik.fletcherlabs.net
2. Create initial admin account (NO 2FA per CIO directive)
3. Configure OAuth2/OIDC providers for:
   - Longhorn UI
   - Grafana
   - Prometheus (needs HTTPRoute first)
4. Update service configurations with auth

### Priority 2 - Monitoring Alerts
Configure critical alerts for:
- Longhorn volume health
- CSI driver status  
- Backup job failures
- Node disk space
- Authentication failures

### Priority 3 - Documentation
- Update operational runbooks
- Create Longhorn operations guide
- Document security procedures
- Update disaster recovery plans

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Check cluster health
kubectl get nodes && flux get all -A

# View current backups
velero backup get

# Access key services
echo "Longhorn: https://longhorn.fletcherlabs.net"
echo "Grafana: https://grafana.fletcherlabs.net" 
echo "Authentik: https://authentik.fletcherlabs.net"

# Run setup helper
/home/josh/flux-k3s/scripts/authentik-initial-setup.sh
```

## ðŸ“š Essential Documentation

1. **[CLUSTER-SETUP.md](CLUSTER-SETUP.md)** - Updated with current state
2. **[DAY-SHIFT-SUMMARY-2025-06-15.md](DAY-SHIFT-SUMMARY-2025-06-15.md)** - Today's accomplishments
3. **[docs/LONGHORN-INCIDENT-POSTMORTEM-2025-06-15.md](docs/LONGHORN-INCIDENT-POSTMORTEM-2025-06-15.md)** - Incident analysis
4. **[docs/NEXT-STEPS-AFTER-LONGHORN-2025-06-15.md](docs/NEXT-STEPS-AFTER-LONGHORN-2025-06-15.md)** - Original roadmap

## ðŸ”§ Known Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **MinIO Local Storage** - Broken but B2 backups working fine
2. **DCGM Exporter** - GPU metrics failing (not critical)
3. **Traefik Noise** - K3s trying to install (we use Cilium)
4. **Longhorn fsGroup** - Monitoring using local-path workaround

## ðŸ’¡ Key Achievements

- **Zero to Hero**: From complete storage failure to full data protection in 48 hours
- **Automation**: Backups now run automatically without intervention
- **Security**: All secrets encrypted, auth gateway ready
- **Monitoring**: Full observability with persistent storage

The cluster is now more resilient than before the incident. The painful nuclear option gave us a clean foundation to build on properly.
