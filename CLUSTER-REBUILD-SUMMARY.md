# K3s Cluster Rebuild Summary - June 16, 2025

## What Was Accomplished

### Complete Cluster Rebuild
- Torn down corrupted K3s cluster with 167 duplicate mounts
- Deployed fresh K3s v1.32.5+k3s1 with embedded etcd
- Implemented full GitOps with Flux v2.6.1
- Removed Longhorn distributed storage (source of original issues)

### Infrastructure Deployed
1. **Networking**: Cilium CNI with BGP and Gateway API support
2. **Certificate Management**: cert-manager v1.16.2
3. **GPU Support**: Intel and NVIDIA GPU operators
4. **Storage**: Local-path provisioner for simple persistent storage
5. **Node Feature Discovery**: For hardware detection

### Applications Deploying
- Media stack (Bazarr, etc.) starting up
- Monitoring namespace created
- AI workloads ready to deploy

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Fix Longhorn Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Remove longhorn dependency from monitoring kustomization
   # Update any PVCs using longhorn storage class
   ```

2. **Bring k3s1 and k3s2 Online**
   - Nodes currently offline/unreachable
   - Will join as control plane nodes for HA

3. **Configure Monitoring Stack**
   - Deploy Prometheus/Grafana
   - Enable ServiceMonitors for cert-manager

4. **Re-enable Cert-Manager Issuers**
   ```bash
   # Uncomment letsencrypt-issuer.yaml in cert-manager kustomization
   ```

### Commands to Monitor Progress
```bash
# Watch Flux reconciliation
flux get kustomizations --watch

# Check application pods
kubectl get pods -A

# View any failing resources
kubectl get all -A | grep -E "(Error|CrashLoop|Pending)"
```

## Architecture Notes

### Why These Choices Were Made
- **K3s over K8s**: Production-grade but lightweight
- **No Longhorn**: Avoiding the fsGroup bug that caused the original issues
- **Cilium CNI**: Enterprise features, BGP support for future expansion
- **GitOps First**: Everything through Flux for reproducibility

### Storage Strategy
- Local-path for configs and small data
- NFS mounts for media libraries (to be configured)
- No distributed storage complexity

## Recovery Status
‚úÖ Cluster operational
‚úÖ GitOps pipeline functional
üîÑ Applications deploying
‚è≥ HA nodes to be added

The cluster is now in a clean, functional state with a solid foundation for growth.
