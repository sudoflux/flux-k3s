# K3s Cluster Handoff - June 15, 2025

## Executive Summary

Major progress made on cluster stability. K3s1 node successfully upgraded from v1.30.13 to v1.32.5, and ALL nodes have been standardized to use the correct kubelet path (`/var/lib/kubelet`). This resolved the Longhorn CSI mounting issues across the cluster.

### Major Accomplishments
1. **K3s1 Upgrade Completed**: Successfully upgraded to v1.32.5 matching other nodes
2. **Kubelet Path Standardization**: All 4 nodes now use `/var/lib/kubelet` consistently
3. **Longhorn CSI Recovery**: Fixed instance manager issues and volume attachments
4. **Media Apps Recovering**: Most media apps now running after volume attachment fixes
5. **Monitoring Stack Progress**: Loki running successfully with proper permissions

## Current Cluster State

### Node Status
- **k3s-master1**: v1.32.5, kubelet path standardized ✅
- **k3s1**: v1.32.5 (upgraded from v1.30.13), kubelet path standardized ✅
- **k3s2**: v1.32.5, kubelet path standardized, instance manager recovered ✅
- **k3s3**: v1.32.5, kubelet path standardized ✅

### Storage Configuration
- **Longhorn**: Operational with all nodes using correct kubelet paths
- **CSI Plugin**: Running on all worker nodes (k3s1, k3s2, k3s3)
- **Instance Managers**: All running after k3s2 recovery

### Application Status

#### Media Namespace (Mostly Recovered)
- ✅ Running: Bazarr, Jellyfin, Overseerr, Whisparr
- ⏳ Still Starting: Lidarr, Prowlarr, Radarr, SABnzbd, Sonarr (ContainerCreating)
- These apps are recovering from volume attachment issues caused by the kubelet path mismatch

#### Monitoring Stack (Partial Recovery)
- ✅ Loki: Running with fsGroup permissions fix and memberlist service
- ⏳ Prometheus: Init container running (waiting for config reload)
- ⏳ Alertmanager: Init container running (waiting for config reload)
- ✅ Grafana: Should be running (using local-path storage)

## Technical Details

### K3s1 Upgrade Process
1. Created SQLite backup at `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/db/state.db.backup.20250614`
2. Upgraded using official K3s install script
3. Resolved authentication issues by completely reinstalling k3s-agent with fresh token

### Kubelet Path Standardization
Applied to all nodes via `/etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml`:
```yaml
kubelet-arg:
  - "root-dir=/var/lib/kubelet"
```

### Key Fixes Applied
1. **Loki Permissions**: Used fsGroup (10001) instead of root initContainer
2. **Loki Clustering**: Created memberlist headless service
3. **Volume Attachments**: Cleaned up stale attachments from old kubelet paths
4. **Instance Manager**: Recovered k3s2's instance manager from error state

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Monitor Media Pod Recovery**: Continue watching ContainerCreating pods
2. **Check Monitoring Stack**: Verify Prometheus and Alertmanager complete initialization
3. **Longhorn Helm Upgrade**: Still failing with pre-upgrade hooks - may need investigation
4. **Cleanup Completed Pods**: Many completed/error pods need cleanup across namespaces

## Important Notes

### Volume Recovery Context
- Many volumes were stuck in "attaching" state due to kubelet path mismatch
- Instance manager on k3s2 was in error state and needed restart
- Some pods may take extended time to start as volumes recover

### Collaborative Approach Used
- Successfully used zen MCP tools (o3-mini debug analysis)
- Gemini 2.5 Pro provided two-phase standardization plan
- O3 Mini identified stale volume attachment root cause

## Unresolved Issues

1. **Longhorn Helm Upgrade**: Pre-upgrade hooks still failing
   - Error: "job longhorn-pre-upgrade failed: BackoffLimitExceeded"
   - May need to investigate pre-upgrade job requirements

2. **Slow Pod Startup**: Some media pods taking 15+ minutes to start
   - Related to volume attachment recovery process
   - Should resolve as Longhorn stabilizes

3. **Cleanup Needed**: Multiple namespaces have completed/error pods
   - Use cleanup scripts to remove old resources

## Session Summary

This session focused on stabilizing the cluster infrastructure:
- Upgraded the last node (k3s1) to matching K8s version
- Standardized all nodes to use consistent kubelet paths
- Recovered from Longhorn CSI volume attachment issues
- Made significant progress on monitoring and media app recovery

The cluster is now much more stable with consistent configuration across all nodes. The remaining issues are primarily related to recovery from the previous misconfiguration and should resolve with time.

## Documentation Updates

- **Updated**: K3s1 upgrade procedure documented
- **Validated**: Longhorn CSI fix works across all nodes
- **Created**: Loki configuration fixes (fsGroup, memberlist service)
